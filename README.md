## Developer Talk on Current Version:
Hello, Zeyn The Dev here. Yeah, I never expected that this project could be born just because of my boredom on the weekend days lol :v Since I consulted AI actively on this project, so maybe there's many minor bugs, or many misspoints that should be configured for better performance and experience. I'll be so helpful for your feedbacks so let's we enjoy this application development together. But hey, people said, "If it worked, don't touch it" so can we guess this one as a step to success? :v
