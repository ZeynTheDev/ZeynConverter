Oh, wait...  
I'm here wasn't for singing, but to talk about the current version! Hehe~

Okay, so, every detail about the current update (what's new, what's got fixed, bla bla bla) can be seen on the release page so just go here. I have no interest to discuss them here. Yeah, actually it's not a patch nor a big update, but just a minor fix but as I said: I have no interest to discuss them here so let's aside this topic.

Umm... What's again.... Oh, I remember! So, the development will be held for a while. My test will be held in late November so I need to start studying from now. Also, before that, I need to show my project result to my AI lecturer. No-no, it's not literally AI like terminator, but a lecturer on AI subject (I guess how wild people imagination that think that way :/) so yeah, I need to show that my model can classify the dataset properly. Let's hope I got A, or at least, B on this subject. Also, I have some planned activities on November and December IRL so yeah, let's just watch it.

So, as explained, that's the reason why the development would be held.

> "If that so, why do you release this minor update?"

Good question. Err.. actually, I got bored to always waiting the model training. Yes, it's fun, but it start boring when you overdo it. So that, I release it. Yeah, whatever.

Ok, maybe just it for this release. The next release would come in patch (`v0.2.0`). I think it would consuming a long time since the library for WebP was installed on my project, but it won't work when I start clean and build it. I'll try to find the way to configure it. ~~Let's hope I'm not got lazy for releasing the next patch.~~

Bye :)
